# YouPiP

This tweak enables native Picture-in-Picture feature for videos in iOS YouTube app, including the dedicated PiP button if preferred.

You can activate PiP by playing the video and dismissing the app, or tapping PiP button in video tab bar or control overlay.

## Build it yourself

Use iOS 15+ SDK and latest THEOS.

Also clone [YTVideoOverlay](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTVideoOverlay) and put it in the same directory as this project.

## Sideloading

Ensure that you inject YTVideoOverlay tweak alongside YouPiP, as YouPiP depends on YTVideoOverlay to work.
