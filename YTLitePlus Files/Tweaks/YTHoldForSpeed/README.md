**YTHoldForSpeed** allows you to quickly toggle between a selected video playback speed by tapping and holding on the video player in the YouTube application. There is also the option to automatically apply the selected speed when a new video player is launched.

This tweak was tested on various versions of the YouTube application released between 2020 and 2023 with the last known working version being **19.03.2**. The tweak has been tested on iOS 14.7.1 with checkra1n, iOS 15.1.1 as a sideloaded app, and iOS 15.7.5 / 16.4.1 with palera1n-c (rootless). It is compatible with all devices on iOS 13 to iOS 16.

## *Settings*

Navigate to the Settings panel within YouTube to find a new section titled "Hold for speed." Here you can configure the following:

*   Hold gesture (please be aware that by enabling this feature, the stock tap and hold gesture will be disabled)
*   Disable stock gestures (please be aware that if the hold gesture is enabled, the stock gestures will be automatically disabled)
*   Automatically apply speed
*   Toggle speed
*   Hold duration (in seconds)
*   Haptic feedback (only shown for devices that support haptic feedback)
